## Files Explained üóÇÔ∏è
- **`Dockerfile`**: this docker file creates an image along with the required dependencies and files for the `notify.py` file.
- **`notify.py`**: this Python script sends personalized email notifications to users subscribed to keyword trends. It connects to a PostgreSQL database to fetch significant changes in keyword mentions and matches them with user subscription thresholds. 
- **`requirements.txt`**: this project requires specific Python libraries to run correctly. These dependencies are listed in this file and are needed to ensure your environment matches the project's environment requirements.
